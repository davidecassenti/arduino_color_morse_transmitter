Arduino Color Morse Transmitter
===============================

This is my first project made with an Arduino UNO. It is super-simple, and requires only few components:

- 1x Arduino UNO board (indeed)
- 3x 220 Ohm Resistors
- 1x 3-colors LED diode
- 1x Breadboard and few wires to connect everything

Code
----
The code is very simple: there is a single function that can be called in the loop, called `morse`; the function expects 4 parameters: the first, is the text to show in morse code; the other three parameters are the Red, Green and Blue component of the color (from 0 to 255).


Circuit
-------
The image of the final circuit has been created using **fritzing**; the software is Open Source, and can be downloaded here: <http://fritzing.org>
